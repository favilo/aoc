# Advent of Code 2021

To run all days:

```sh
cargo run --release
```

Timings generated by:

The `cargo-criterion` crate is useful to get nice benchmarks.

```sh
cargo criterion
```

Though not required, this just doesn't have as nice output, and will deprecate plots soon:

```sh
cargo bench
```

## Failed experiments

### Day 6

I tried to be more clever than the optimizer, but failed. If you use add
`--features day06_ring` you can see the awful timings I got when attempting to
use a ring buffer to update in place. It _works_, but it ended up being about 3000% slower

```
day06/get_input         time:   [4.2848 us 4.3215 us 4.3654 us]
                        change: [-3.9853% -2.3302% -0.6116%] (p = 0.01 < 0.05)
                        Change within noise threshold.
day06/part1             time:   [262.28 ns 266.21 ns 270.56 ns]
                        change: [+3033.7% +3134.4% +3236.0%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)
                        Performance has regressed.
day06/part2             time:   [836.93 ns 852.07 ns 869.67 ns]
                        change: [+1851.4% +1892.5% +1933.2%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)
                        Performance has regressed.
